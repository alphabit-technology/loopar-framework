 * Owner filter for a list of `entityName`, bound to the CURRENT REQUEST.
 *
 * Returns the request controller's `ownerFilters()` only when the entity being
 * listed IS the document the request targets and the request's grant has
 * scope 'own'. Any other read — a different entity loaded inside an action,
 * a job, an installer, a hook — gets null and is never narrowed. This is what
 * makes it safe to apply at model level (BaseDocument.getList): a controller
 * overriding `actionList` still goes through the filter, but Invoice.update
 * reading Materials does not.
 *
 * `loopar.getList(doc, { unscoped: true })` is the explicit escape hatch.
